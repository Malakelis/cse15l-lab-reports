Lab report 1.

In this first screenshot we have three examples of the cd command. One example I have is where the cd command is used with no arguments and this results in nothing because I have not provided an argument for the cd command to change directory to. This is not an error as the programmers did not intend for cd to be used with no argument. However, in the next screenshot I do provide an argument and that is with the Hello.java file. An error is shown and this is because Hello.java is not a directory with which you can cd or change directory to. We get this output because cd is not meant to be used with a file like Hello.java but rather directories as the name "change directory" implies. The first example in the screenshot works however because lecture1 is a directory with which you can change directory to. As a result, the command is used properly and cd changes our directory to be in the lecture1 folder.

In this second screenshot I demonstrate three examples of the ls command. In the first example I show how ls can be used when the argument is a file such as Hello.class. Here, ls will simply list the file name and nothing more as the file will not have any sub directories like a folder so it will not act like a directory and list multiple things. Next, I have a second example where we use the ls command to list what is in the messages directory. In this case it is the 4 langauge.txt files. The ls command works here because it is used properly with a directory as the argument. In the final example I provide in the screenshot, ls is used with no arguments and this will simply print everything that is in our current working directory which is in the lecture1 folder.

In this third screenshot I demonstrate three examples of the cat command. In the first example I use the cat command with a directory. Here, the cat command will not work correctly and it will essentially be an error. This is because you can not use the cat command with a directory as it is built to read and print data from files. In the second example I have provided in the screenshot, I show how the cat command works when you use it with a file such as Hello.java. Here, the cat command will work because it is built to work with files such as .java or even .txt files and a multitude of different file types. In this example it works, and thus prints the contents of the Hello.java file. In the final example I have provided in the screenshot, I use cat with no arguments and thus it once again does not work properly and I also have to exit out of the command with ctrl c to exit the task it had put my terminal in. It did not work because you can not use cat with no commands.
