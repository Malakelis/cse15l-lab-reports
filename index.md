Lab report 2.

Num is incremented by 1 and set to 1.
Num variable initailized to 0.
I have a string variable called previous and it is called each time and concatenates num value to the beginning and then uses the parameters string array to get a value for the string that is added. After that that line is returned to be displayed on the webserver site. If nothing is found then it will return a 404 error. URI is a value that is intialized with the localhost website url locally. Some methods are also called like .equals() to compare two objects and then the getPath() command to get the url path. In this case it will first parameters[1] to CHEESE and then return that with the num value to display on the web server.

In week 2 and 3 I learned many things about web servers such as queries and tinkering with web urls and code to add messages and then display them on a webpage. This is interesting because you can even make a mini Google search browser by adding various elements and then searching for them using a search implementation in the code. I also learned about the man command which can be pretty useful as it can basically display a user manual of how the command you inputted works and is supposed to run on the terminal.
