In week 2 and 3 I learned many things about web servers such as queries and tinkering with web urls and code to add messages and then display them on a webpage. This is interesting because you can even make a mini Google search browser by adding various elements and then searching for them using a search implementation in the code. I also learned about the man command which can be pretty useful as it can basically display a user manual of how the command you inputted works and is supposed to run on the terminal.
